# Test_Reign

We would like you to build a small mobile application to test your knowledge of iOS or Android
technologies.</br>
You can choose to complete the task using any one of:</br>
* Kotlin (required) for Android as an Android Studio project</br>
</br>
Please refer to the attached wireframe for an understanding of what the finished app should look</br>
like.</br>
On startup, and when the listview is pulled down to refresh, the app should connect to this API
which shows recently posted articles about Android or iOS on Hacker News:</br>
https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search_by_date?query=mobile</br>
If the app is used offline, it should show the items downloaded last time.</br>
The main view of the app is a scrolling list view of recent posts in date order. If the user taps on a</br>
post, show a web view (within the app) with the linked article. Also, you should be able to swipe</br>
on a cell, and delete an individual post from this view (see mockups). Once a post is deleted it</br>
should not reappear even if the data is refreshed.</br>
It is not necessary to create an optimised layout for tablet devices.</br>
You are welcome to use any 3rd party libraries to complete the task.</br>
